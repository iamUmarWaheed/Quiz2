    <h1>Differentiate arrow functions and regular functions.</h1>
    <p>
        Since regular functions are constructible, they can be called using the new keyword. However, the arrow functions are only callable and not constructible, i.e arrow functions can never be used as constructor functions. Hence, they can never be invoked with the new keyword.
    </p>
    <p>e.g. 
        regular function represented by <b> "()"</b>
        Arrow function represented by <b> "=>"</b>
    </p>
